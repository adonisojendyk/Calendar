# Calendar
Exercise from Introduction to Java Programming and Data Structures by Y. Daniel Liang. 
Class: INTRO TO PROGRAMMING 

5.29 - (input via dialog box and output via command window) You may have heard about it, it is the calendar program. Your code should not go over 150 lines of code and can actually be done in under 100. The output needs to be neat clean tables of dates for each month with a nice header above each month, just like it shows in the book. Remember to handle leap years. Remember the formula for this is in Chp. 3 on page 97.
